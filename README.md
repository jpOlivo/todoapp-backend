# TODO app - backend
Backend implemented on Spring Boot that serves REST services to an Angular app ([TODO app](https://github.com/jpOlivo/todoapp-frontend)) in order to perform CRUD operations on a MongoDB instance created on [mLab](https://mlab.com/).

This implementation is based in [this tutorial](https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-mongodb-angular-js-rest-api-tutorial/).

# Running the app
The backend app can be executed from [TodoappApplication](https://github.com/jpOlivo/todoapp-backend/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/todoapp/TodoappApplication.java) class.

# API REST
The documentation of API Rest is available in [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/)
